# HealthTracker
Health tracking application for Android OS by considering OOP design and programming paradigm.

# Three Functionalities of the Application 

# Body Mass Index (BMI) 
  Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women by using an equation. The value obtained from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese depending on what range the value falls between.
  
  You are expected to design and develop a form to calculate BMI index by taking necessary information from the user, and then inform the user about his/her weight category.

BMI = weight (kg) ÷ height^2 (m^2)
  
# Estimated Energy Requirement (EER) 
  EER is average dietary energy intake that is predicted to maintain energy balance in healthy, normal weight individuals of a defined age, gender, weight, height, and level of physical activity consistent with good health. EER is calculated by using the table below.

MEN   | EER = 662 - (9.53 * age [y]) + PA * { (15.91 * weight [kg]) + (539.6 * height [m]) } \
WOMAN | EER = 354 - (6.91 * age [y]) + PA * { (9.36 * weight [kg]) + (726 * height [m]) } 


  You are expected to design and develop another form to calculate EER by taking necessary information from the user, and then inform the user about his/her daily estimated energy requirement.

# Personal Health Tracking
  In this part of the project, you are required to take daily personal blood pressure (tension), blood sugar, heart rate (pulse), weight information from the user. If the entered values are out of the normal ranges, you should inform the user. In addition, you are expected to present weekly or monthly graphics for monitoring changes in these values.

# PROJECT TEAM
This Android application was done by a group of 2 people (Filiz Devrim YILMAZ & Ezgi Berfin ŞAHİN).
